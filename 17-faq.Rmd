## Why am I getting weird variable names? {-}

<div align="center">

</div>

Unfortunately this can happen on windows computers.You can fix it with the following code

```{r,eval=F} 
names(smoking)[1] = "Age"
```

This code looks at the column names, picks the first one, and then reassigns it to Age.


## How do I produce a residual plot with missing values in data? {-}

```{r , warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
help(msleep)
plot(sleep$bodywt, sleep$brainwt)
L = lm(sleep$brainwt ~ sleep$bodywt)
summary(L)
abline(L)

# Correlation (with missing values)
length(sleep$bodywt) 
length(sleep$brainwt) 
cor(sleep$bodywt, sleep$brainwt, use = "complete.obs")  


# Residual plot (with missing values)
length(sleep$bodywt) 
length(L$residuals)
residuals1 = resid(lm(sleep$brainwt ~ sleep$bodywt, na.action=na.exclude)) 
length(residuals1)
plot(sleep$bodywt,residuals1)
```
## How can I eliminate NAs from my dataset? {-}

The function `drop_na()` from the `dplyr` package (a subset of the `tidyverse` package) allows you to remove rows from a dataset that contain NAs.

We will use the `msleep` data set for this example.

First lets find out how many NAs are in each row of the dataset:

```{r, eval=T}
dim(msleep)
colSums(is.na(msleep))
```

By using the drop_na function we can see all rows with an NA in it was removed. This took our row count from 83 to 20 complete entries.
```{r, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
sleep_clean = drop_na(msleep)
dim(sleep_clean)
colSums(is.na(sleep_clean))
```
However, what if we are only interested in deleting rows where `brainwt` is NA? This could be the case with the large datasets used in the projects, with a number of redundant columns. In some cases deleting all NAs results in very few observations remaining, so we can be more selective about the rows we remove. If for example, `sleep_cycle` is used nowhere in our analysis, it would be unnecessary to remove rows when `sleep_cycle` is NA.

You can selectively delete NAs from select rows using the code below:
```{r, eval = F}
# delete rows where brainwt is NA
drop_na(msleep, brainwt)

#delete rows where brainwt, vore OR sleep rem is NA
drop_na(msleep, c(brainwt, vore,sleep_rem))
```


## What does %>% mean? {-}

`%>%` means "pipe", and it takes the output of the previous function and puts it into ("pipes" it into) the next function. see the below code for examples:

```{r eval = F}
# Previous Notation
sum(c(1,2,3))

# Pipe Notation
c(1,2,3) %>% sum()

# Previous Notation
cos(sin(pi))

#Pipe Notation
pi %>% sin() %>% cos()
```
This method allows us to read code from left to right rather than inside out. The shortcut for a pipe on windows in Rstudio should be set to Ctrl + Shift + M by default (Cmd + Shift + M for macbook users).

Within `ggplot` we can use this to pipe data into our `ggplot` argument like so:
```{r eval = F}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = cyl, group = cyl, y = disp)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

For more information see [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial)

## Error: ... could not find function "%>%" {-}

The pipe operator is apart of the `tidyverse`, thus if you encounter this message it means you have not loaded the `tidyverse` library in your document. Resolve by loading the library at the top of your document like so:

```{r eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
```


## How do I select only a subset of my dataset that matches a certain criteria? {-}

When we have a large data set, sometimes we only want to look at a subset of it for our analysis. To do this we will use the `filter` function from the `dplyr` library. 

### Filtering for a single condition {-}

The below code filters the data for only the Setosa species and saves the data into a data frame called `iris_setosa`.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, eval=T}
library(tidyverse)     # The tidyverse package includes the dplyr package

iris_setosa = iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa")
```

This is what the resulting data frame looks like, as you can see it only contains entries that are of the species Setosa.

<details><summary>Show Data</summary>
```{r, echo=F, eval = T, warning=F, message=F}
library(kableExtra)
iris_setosa %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "250px")
```
</details>

### Filtering for multiple conditions {-}
We can also use the `filter` function to filter for multiple conditions by separating the conditions with a comma. The code below selects from the `iris` data only the entries that are of the Setosa species and have a petal length greater than 1.5 and saves the results in a data frame called `iris_filtered`.

```{r, eval=T}
iris_filtered = iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa", Petal.Length > 1.5)
```
And this is the resulting data

<details><summary>Show Data</summary>
```{r, echo=F,eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
iris_filtered %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% scroll_box(height = "250px") 
```
</details>

### Filtering for multiple values of a single variable {-}

The code below filters the `iris` data for entries which are either the Setosa or Virginica species using the `%in%` keyword. This method is not limited to only two values, you may list as many values which you want to filter for as you like.

```{r, eval=T}
iris_filtered = iris %>% filter(Species %in% c("setosa", "virginica"))
```
<details><summary>Show Data</summary>
```{r, echo=F, waring=F, message=F, eval=T}
iris_filtered %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "250px")
```
</details>

## How can you find the mean of different groups in a dataset? {-}

To summarise the data by group, we use a combination of the `group_by` and `summarise` function.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% #separates the dataset into three groups: 4, 6 and 8 according to cyl
  summarise(avg_disp = mean(disp)) # finds the mean disp of each group and calls it avg_disp
```

You can expand on this methodology to find many different summary statistics! See an example below: 

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(avg_disp = mean(disp),# finds the mean disp of each group and calls it avg_disp
            count = n(), # finds the number of rows in each cyl group
            sum_mpg = sum(mpg))  # finds the sum of the mpg variable within each cyl group
```
