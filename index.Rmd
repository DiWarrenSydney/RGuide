# Aim {-}

- This is a self-study guide to R.
- It allows you to consolidate your learning from labs, by learning new R commands through the one simple data set `mtcars`, which is already stored in R.
- Sections marked ** are more for DATA1901, and for students who want to extend themselves.


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```
